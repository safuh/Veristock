cp .env.example .env
make check
make run
```

The API documentation is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

Kubernetes/Kustomize manifests are not included.

## Architecture

The project includes a FastAPI application factory, Pydantic Settings, async SQLAlchemy persistence,
Alembic migrations, health/readiness endpoints, structured logging, authentication primitives,
and tests. Review the security documentation before enabling authentication in production.

This project is an independent copy. It does not retain the source repository's Git history.
